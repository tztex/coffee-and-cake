  <p>A cupcake (also known as a fairy cake) is a small cake designed to be eaten
    by one person, baked in a thin paper wrapper, and decorated with frosting on
    top.</p>
  <p>One of the mainstays at Coffee & Cake is our famous Red Velvet Cupcake. A
    well-guarded recipe combined with the natural ingredients make this little
    red rascal unapologetically delicious. Topped with decorative vanilla
    frosting, the Red Velvet Cupcake is a favorite among kids as well.</p>
